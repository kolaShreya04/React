# React

props -> variables passed from parent to child
    body component -> carousel component
    children cannot pass pros to parents
    child can control parents variables through a function passed from parent to child 

state -> component own variables 
    ability to create and change limited to the parent
    can pass the value of the variable to child as a prop
        functional component -> hooks
        class component -> this.setState()

 Any change to props and state will cause a re-render
